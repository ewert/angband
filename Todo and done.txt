Plan is to improve QoL

Plan:
Artifacts should not ever be too shallow to be created, they are artifacts
Autopickup not picking up if disturbed on the same movement
Another rebalance of item drop levels
Look into other options to bypass annoying or dangerous monsters, especially non-uniques
  - polymorph chances? beholders, hydras, etc. high hp high dmg no drop monsters should have other options
Scare, confuse, hold spells, rebalance with the idea of making them escape-like
  - Break on dmg, but stronger otherwise
Consideration into other rarely used spells / items
  - Wand vs staff vs rod of same items, strength of effect differences? Easy vs heavy vs rare considerations
Options to pause game for x seconds if HP trigger reached?
  - my playspeed is blazingly fast in real time, I feel having a stronger HP alarm would be nice to avoid the finger-taps-twice-dead mistakes
Randart creation
  - weighing or limiting certain bonuses to certain item slots?

Home inventory management
  - just keeping my preference of having a big home to hoard all the artifacts in ;)


Done:

Torches can be created at any level
Object creation does NOT check for artifact maximum depth
This completes Artifact creation issues as far as I see

Added autopickup cmd hook to disturbing running, hopefully this was the issue in my gameplay causing missed gold pickups
(will need to re-assess to make sure I am not using energy after a disturb, most likely will make gold pickup separate)
